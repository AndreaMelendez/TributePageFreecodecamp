          <h3>Ada Lovelace during her life made:</h3>
          <li>She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation.</li>
          <li>Published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine.</li>
          <li>She is sometimes regarded as the first to recognise the full potential of a "computing machine" and the first computer programmer.</li>
          <li>Her educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday and the author Charles Dickens, which she used to further her education.</li>
          <li>When she was a teenager, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, also known as "the father of computers", and in particular, Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine.</li>
